                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency
                    is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens
                    hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
                    transparent.
                </p>
                <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
                    spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
                    and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                    about what their Government is doing.
                </p>
                <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
                    effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
                    and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
                    our site to become actively engaged in American government.
                </p>
                <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                    public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.
                </p>

                <h2 class="margin-top">Background History of Government Transparency</h2>
                <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                    opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
                    on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
                    formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example,
                    (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
                    part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the
                    philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                    public sphere.
                </p>
                <p> Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of
                    the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                    press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to
                    row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                    writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.
                </p>
                <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often
                    linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
                    adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to
                    the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence
                    in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation
                    in 1999).
